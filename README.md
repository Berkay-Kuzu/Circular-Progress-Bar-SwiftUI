# Circular-Progress-Bar-SwiftUI

This is a circular progress bar built with SwiftUI. The circular bar moves with animation when the users click the circular bar. This bar can be applied different apps related to the progress such as workout app. I, first, try to draw the circle and then fill the circle with animation. I specifically used Shape protocol in order to be able to use custom shape in this app. Besides, I benefited from computed properties to form animation.
